Project 6: Two-Port Networks

1. Two-Port Network
A second order bandpass filter is given, with L1 = 112.54 nH, C1 = 37.806 fF, L2 = 94.514 pH, and C2 = 45.016 pF.

The center frequency and a-parameters were found. The circuit was split into four separate blocks (two-port networks containing one component each) and the a-parameters were found for each. Code was writted to calculate the a-parameter matrices as a function of frequency from 1-3.5 GHz. They were then cascaded at each point in frequency.

The filter was then terminated by a 50-ohm load and excited by a source with a 50-ohm source load. The voltage transfer function is H(Ï‰) = V2/Vg
The transfer function was found and plotted in dB vs frequency. The maximum amplitude was found.
